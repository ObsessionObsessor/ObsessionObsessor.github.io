What conditions and issues led to mistrust between the U.S. and USSR, thereby leading to the Cold War?</a></h3>

<p>Relationships between the US and the USSR, which were competing superpowers, had been worsening for some time during WWII, for depth, Joseph Stalin allying with Hitler before Hitler attacked the USSR, the United States refraining from attacking Germany after Germany attacked the USSR, and the United States keeping it’s development of the Atomic Bomb secret all contributed to worsening relationships. After WWII, the United Nations was used by the US and USSR to spread their influence over others. Finally, after Stalin refused to allow free elections, Truman was convinced that the United State’s and the USSR’s aims were at odds.</p>

<h3>2. What methods did the U.S. try to attempt to stop the spread of communism in Eastern Europe?</h3>
<p>The United States’ Congress gave $400,000,000 in economic and military aid for Greece and Turkey after the President at the time, President Truman, requested the Congress, saying “It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” This is called the Truman Doctrine.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Why did the U.S. turn to military action to stop communist aggression in Korea?</h3>

<p>The U.S. turned to military action in Korea because of a variety of reasons, including military advisors thinking that Korea was insecure against Communism. These Advisors thought that because in Mao Zedong and his Communist party had come into power in China, and because of that President Truman faced criticism from Republicans that claimed that President Truman “lost” China. After this, McCarthyism begun, and finally North Korea started invading South Korea while McCarthyism was still going on. </p>
<h3>4. Why did Americans respond in the manner they did to perceived internal threats, such as “blacklisting” and “McCarthyism”? </h3>
<p>Americans responded in the way they did, which was to become even more frantic about Communistic Hysteria than they were before, there were a few actual spy cases that were politicised by the media and overly punished. Americans were already looking towards themselves to some extent, as there was actually a Communist Party. Blacklisting and McCarthyism essentially just created more conflict within the cause of Anti-Communism. 
</p>
<h3>5. How did the Cold War change the lives of Americans?</h3>
<p>The Cold War made Americans more paranoid and divided than before, forcing them to take pledges of loyalty, movies were banned and actors and screenwriters careers were arbitrarily and forcibly ended through the House Un-American Activities Committee. The Cold War also resulted in creating the Interstate Highway System and left it’s mark on literature. </p>
