<h3>4. Why did Americans respond in the manner they did to perceived internal threats, such as “blacklisting” and “McCarthyism”? </h3>
<p>Americans responded in the way they did, which was to become even more frantic about Communistic Hysteria than they were before, there were a few actual spy cases that were politicised by the media and overly punished. Americans were already looking towards themselves to some extent, as there was actually a Communist Party. Blacklisting and McCarthyism essentially just created more conflict within the cause of Anti-Communism. 
</p>
<h3>5. How did the Cold War change the lives of Americans?</h3>
<p>The Cold War made Americans more paranoid and divided than before, forcing them to take pledges of loyalty, movies were banned and actors and screenwriters careers were arbitrarily and forcibly ended through the House Un-American Activities Committee. The Cold War also resulted in creating the Interstate Highway System and left it’s mark on literature. </p>
